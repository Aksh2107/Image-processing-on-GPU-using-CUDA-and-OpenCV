# Image-processing-on-GPU-using-CUDA-and-OpenCV

CUDA and the GPU enable faster training of neural networks and other deep-learning algorithms, which has transformed computer vision research.
NVIDIA is working on several hardware platforms that will aid in developing computer vision applications.
I used CUDA to implement a number of the basic operations and filter design of digotal image processing.
All of the implementation was learned from the book listed below.
